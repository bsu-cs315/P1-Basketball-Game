# Project 1, Iteration 3: Titles and Animation
Third iteration of a multi part project by Jacob Dibble

Physics game based off Angry Birds

GitHub Pages: https://bsu-cs315.github.io/P1-Basketball-Game/
* Note: the render of this project in Github Pages will cause some items to be misaligned due to different screen sizes. 
## Project Report
The most challenging part of this iteration was ensuring the style guide complied with every little bit of my code. Every time I thought I was finished I found something else that needed to be refactered to align with the style guide, and now I believe everything is compliant. The most interesting thing I found about this iteration was how easy using the animation node is. Being able to modify nearly any aspect of another node in the animation object is very cool and quite robust.
